# Claim Triangles

A console app that can take in a CSV file of claims data and export an accumulated list

## Building and Running the app
Open a command prompt and navigate to the `TJ.ClaimTriables` directory

Build the app using `dotnet build` command

Run the app using `'dotnet run` command

File input and outputs are set in the `appsettings` file

## Improvements
Unit tests around the services and mapper function would be good.

Create a separate file handling and import program

A logger utility for feedback

A better mapper with more checks on the data to validate it.
